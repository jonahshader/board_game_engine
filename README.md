# board_game_engine
A highly configurable board game engine written in Kotlin.

A board game engine for implementing games similar to chess. Game rules can be defined with Kotlin DSL like syntax and AI players can be generated or trained for any arbitrary game. Still a work in progress, but some basic minimax algorithms are implemented along with some other experimental ones.
